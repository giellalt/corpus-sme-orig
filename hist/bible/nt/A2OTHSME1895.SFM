\id OTH - Northern Saami Bible 1895
\ip General title, verso of which is a list of books, dated 1895. Text divided into five parts: 1. Pentateuch (1891); 2. Joshua-Esther (1893); 3. Job-Song of Solomon (1894); 4. Isaiah-Malachi (1895); 5. New Testament (1895), with title and list of books, table of Gospels and Epistles. Each part of the Old Testament has its own title, bearing the words “Samas jorggaluvvum Ibmeli gudnen ja Samidi bajasrakadussan”. The New Testament title gives the imprint “Prenteduvvum W.C. Fabritius Ja Barni Lutte”. In 1888 the Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society were asked to undertake the cost of publishing the complete Bible under the supervision of J.A. Friis. A member of the Committee, H.J. Atkinson, offered £200 towards the project, and the Committee guaranteed the remainder of the expense. The Laaps themselves, however, had collected a few hundred kroner, which the Bishop of Tromsö supplemented by gifts from private friends, thus raising sufficient money to print Isaiah. The Bible (without Apocrypha) was issued in separate parts between 1891 and 1895, and the whole was eventually published by the “Norsk Finnemission” (Tromsö), the British and Foreign Bible Society having withdrawn its Agency from Norway in 1891.
\ip O.T.
\ip Lars Hætta continued his translation work and completed the Old Testament, the result being then revised by J.A. Friis (until 1892) and by J. Qvigstad, with some assistance from J.N. Skaar and Salomon Nilsen.
